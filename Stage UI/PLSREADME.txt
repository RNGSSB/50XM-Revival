There are 4 PSD files in this zip. In Smash Ultimate, the UI size for Stages are smaller than the ones
I used in this mod. Because of this, I provided these PSD files for you to make your own as the original
ui would make it stretch out giving unsatisfying results. Here are what each file has. 

SSS Layout

     -   This can be pretty useful if you want to get a small preview of how the stage ui might look 
         like when it loads up on smash. It is something that you won't need to use most of the time
         but it can be useful.

Stage Icons (Stage_1)

     -   This PSD file has the legal stage icons I used for the mod including the neutral,counterpick,
         and banned borders. 

Stages (Stage_2)

     -   Very similar to the Stage Icons PSD file but has the L/LR icon option for stages that you want 
         to have a L-Load on. I also included the new Smash Ultimate and DLC stages  

BF and Omega (Stage_3 & Stage_4)

     -   The exact same as the Stages PSD file but for Battlefield and Omega Forms.

The process for these files is pretty much similar to how you normally do UI for stage just with a new size of the UI. 

If you want to have a different # of stages on the Stage Selection Screen, I highly reccomend downloading
the Layout SSS zip. Also, if you need to reorder the stage order, I recommend using smashultimatetools.com
as it would be a huge help. If you have any more questions, you can contact me on Discord (JoBen#8889).
